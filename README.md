# Intrusion-Detection-System
In this project I designed a prototype that simulates the basic functionalities of an Intrusion Detection System in PL/SQL. Upon entering some attributes of a packet, the project will look for the entry in the database to see if it is malicious. In case the packet is not found in database, KNN algorithm will be run on the server end to predict the class of data.
